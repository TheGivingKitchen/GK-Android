    strength of our organization lies in support from our industry, supplier partners, and community advocates. We also know there are many causes worthy of your
    support. By focusing our resources in a few areas, we feel our impact to the restaurant community is much greater.\n\nWe hate to put you "through the hoops" whenyou are eager to partner with us,
        but this system helps us immensely with our decision-making andrecord-keeping process. We appreciate your commitment and timein supporting our efforts
        to make effective decisions toward the bettermentof our industry.</string>
